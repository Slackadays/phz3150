How did you hear about this course? By looking at the list of OSE "core" prerequisite courses

Do you have a laptop you can bring to class, install software on, etc.? Yes

What operating system and version does it run? Linux (pop!_os)

How much free disk space does it have? 220GB

What operating systems are you comfortable working in? Linux, Windows, macOS 

What computer classes have you taken, including high school,
extracurricular, etc.? None

Have you ever programmed a computer? Yes

   In what language(s)? C++, Python, RISC-V assembly

   Summarize your experience: I first got started with C++ in 2012 by reading this giant "C++11 Primer" textbook cover to cover, and I have a C++ project on GitHub with 4K stars!

Have you taken statistics or probability? Yes (AP Statistics, STA 3032)

Why are you taking this course? I need it to complete the OSE prerequisite requirements

Are there particular topics you hope to learn? I want to try more NumPy and see what amazing things it can do for data inference                                   

If you have worked with scientific data or modeling before, briefly
describe your experience: I did a little NumPy and SciPy before for a physics class

Have you ever been involved with a science club or similar?  If so,
describe: I haven't been part of any science clubs YET

Opened log with gedit, already have Anaconda/Jupyter installed from a while ago, took screenshot of Jupyer using the Print Screen key
My Python version is 3.11.4
I don't have GH Desktop (not available for Linux) so I have VS Code instead which does the same thing but with more features.

English sentence that has correct syntax but uses incorrect characters: I thnk jewdö is thw bes sport.

English sentence with incorrect syntax but correct characters: The judo I think best sport is.

What main “feature” of natural languages prevents their use (so far) as programming languages, and why? Natural languages let you comprehend sentences even if they're malformed, which lets us make lots of unique expressions by "breaking the rules" in a comprehensible way. Unfortunately, computers don't have such leeway with comprehension, and so we can't use natural languages for programming (yet) because there's no way to program in every possible misuse of a natural language.

Closed gedit and copied this log to hw2_jackson/ and zipped everything up
*****IN: Sat Sep  2 02:25:37 PM EDT 2023
Opened gedit again so I can work on HW3

Start:

Reached the end! Everything is in the Jupyter notebook.
*****OUT: Sat Sep  2 02:38:04 PM EDT 2023
Closed gedit and pushed to GH and copied this log to the HW3 folder so I can submit it by zipping the folder up using my file manager.
*****IN: Sat Sep  2 02:44:03 PM EDT 2023
Opened gedit again so I can work on HW4

Start:

Reached the end already!

I saved my HW4 notebook in VS Code, entered a nice message into the Commit message box, clicked Commit, then the Push button to upload everything to GH.

*****OUT: Sat Sep  2 03:49:52 PM EDT 2023
I'm closing gedit, copying this log over again, and making a zip of everything using my file manager.
*****IN: Sat Sep  2 04:04:30 PM EDT 2023
I'm opening gedit again to work on HW5. 

Start:

Problem 2 "What does it need to include?" This function needs to include the cases in case the part inside the square root gives a result that's negative, 0, or positive because we could have 0, 1, or 2 solutions respectively.

Problem 3: I checked that these answers are correct using my calculator.

note: The instructions are ambiguous as to whether I should put these answers in the log or in the notebook.

*****OUT: Sat Sep  2 04:34:56 PM EDT 2023
I'm closing this log in gedit, committing the notebook to GH and pushing it by using VS Code, and making the zip file through my file manager.
*****IN: Sat Sep  2 04:50:02 PM EDT 2023
I'm opening this log in gedit again to work on HW6 and fix HW5. I'm submitting this log while it's IN because I'm working on HW6 at the same time.

Start:

Problem 1: I couldn't save the plot as a PDF because that function wasn't available, so I saved it as a PNG instead.

Problem 2: Changing the 28th element of q_list to 42.0 works because lists in Python are just collections of regular variables that we can modify whenever we want to whatever. And, changing number 28 works specifically because we are singling it out from the others. Changing the 21st element of q_tuple doesn't work because the tuple type in Python holds constant variables, which means you can't change any of them after constructing the tuple.

I'm closing this file again and committing everything to GH in VS Code. I'm also zipping everything up using my file manager.
*****IN: Sun Sep  3 10:35:10 AM EDT 2023
I'm opening this log again so I can work on HW7.

Start:

Reached the end after lots of interruptions! All my comments are in Jupyter since I don't know which option is preferred, so it's simpler to keep everything there.

Closing this file in gedit and committing everything to GH in VS Code and zipping everything up using the file manager

Opening this file again to work on Midterm Project

Start:
*****OUT: Mon Sep  4 05:58:44 PM EDT 2023
I'm taking a break so I can go training in the pool.
*****IN: Mon Sep  4 07:55:20 PM EDT 2023
I'm working on the Midterm Project again. If you haven't noticed already, I don't take many notes because I do everything in my head.
*****OUT: Mon Sep  4 09:10:29 PM EDT 2023
I'm closing this log once again in gedit and committing everything to GH and zipping everything up using the file manager so that I can submit the Midterm Project.
