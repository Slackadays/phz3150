How did you hear about this course? By looking at the list of OSE "core" prerequisite courses

Do you have a laptop you can bring to class, install software on, etc.? Yes

What operating system and version does it run? Linux (pop!_os)

How much free disk space does it have? 220GB

What operating systems are you comfortable working in? Linux, Windows, macOS 

What computer classes have you taken, including high school,
extracurricular, etc.? None

Have you ever programmed a computer? Yes

   In what language(s)? C++, Python, RISC-V assembly

   Summarize your experience: I first got started with C++ in 2012 by reading this giant "C++11 Primer" textbook cover to cover, and I have a C++ project on GitHub with 4K stars!

Have you taken statistics or probability? Yes (AP Statistics, STA 3032)

Why are you taking this course? I need it to complete the OSE prerequisite requirements

Are there particular topics you hope to learn? I want to try more NumPy and see what amazing things it can do for data inference                                   

If you have worked with scientific data or modeling before, briefly
describe your experience: I did a little NumPy and SciPy before for a physics class

Have you ever been involved with a science club or similar?  If so,
describe: I haven't been part of any science clubs YET

Opened log with gedit, already have Anaconda/Jupyter installed from a while ago, took screenshot of Jupyer using the Print Screen key
My Python version is 3.11.4
I don't have GH Desktop (not available for Linux) so I have VS Code instead which does the same thing but with more features.

English sentence that has correct syntax but uses incorrect characters: I thnk jewdö is thw bes sport.

English sentence with incorrect syntax but correct characters: The judo I think best sport is.

What main “feature” of natural languages prevents their use (so far) as programming languages, and why? Natural languages let you comprehend sentences even if they're malformed, which lets us make lots of unique expressions by "breaking the rules" in a comprehensible way. Unfortunately, computers don't have such leeway with comprehension, and so we can't use natural languages for programming (yet) because there's no way to program in every possible misuse of a natural language.

Closed gedit and copied this log to hw2_jackson/ and zipped everything up

Opened gedit again so I can work on HW3

Start:

Reached the end! Everything is in the Jupyter notebook.
*****OUT: Sat Sep  2 02:38:04 PM EDT 2023
Closed gedit and pushed to GH and copied this log to the HW3 folder so I can submit it by zipping the folder up using my file manager.
