How did you hear about this course? By looking at the list of OSE "core" prerequisite courses

Do you have a laptop you can bring to class, install software on, etc.? Yes

What operating system and version does it run? Linux (pop!_os)

How much free disk space does it have? 220GB

What operating systems are you comfortable working in? Linux, Windows, macOS 

What computer classes have you taken, including high school,
extracurricular, etc.? None

Have you ever programmed a computer? Yes

   In what language(s)? C++, Python, RISC-V assembly

   Summarize your experience: I first got started with C++ in 2012 by reading this giant "C++11 Primer" textbook cover to cover, and I have a C++ project on GitHub with 4K stars!

Have you taken statistics or probability? Yes (AP Statistics, STA 3032)

Why are you taking this course? I need it to complete the OSE prerequisite requirements

Are there particular topics you hope to learn? I want to try more NumPy and see what amazing things it can do for data inference                                   

If you have worked with scientific data or modeling before, briefly
describe your experience: I did a little NumPy and SciPy before for a physics class

Have you ever been involved with a science club or similar?  If so,
describe: I haven't been part of any science clubs YET
